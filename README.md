- Hi! I’m @JadeAlys93
- I have an increasing interest in coding and programming languages, and it seems to get stronger by the day.
- I’m currently learning more about Python and Tableau while making sure my SQL skills are up to snuff.
- Still getting used to this platform, but I look forward to getting more comfortable using GitHub
